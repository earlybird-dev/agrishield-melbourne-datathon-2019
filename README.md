# Introduction
AgriShield is an agricultural insurance marketplace for farmers and brokers based in Australia.

AgriShield utilises **time-series satellite images** and other data resources such rainfall, temperature, soil, etc. to provide users insights and forecast a field's production and also provide data to insurers to help them facilitate their actuarial modelling process.

This repository includes my code on dealing with time-series satellite images.
